# LebanesePoundForecast
A model to predict the black market rate of the Lebanese Pound as part of a Machine Learning course.

In this project, we use a Human Centered Design (HCD) approach to alleviate the impact of the economic crisis in Lebanon that violently struck the Lebanese market by shutting down businesses and diminishing the consumersâ€™ purchasing power.

## How did we do it?

- We interviewed stakeholders and aggregated the relevant data to understand the users' needs
- We brainstormed solutions ranging from an online marketplace to an automatic need-based shopping curator

*We concluded that a Lebanese Lira forecaster would provide the highest sense of financial security to the users*

## What were our next steps?

- We created an initial wireframe with detailed features and user journeys
- We gathered feedback from stakeholders and iterated on our design
- We conducted a literature review to understand the solution landscape
- We collected, cleaned and visualized daily value of the black market Lebanese Lira over the course of 1 year
- We implemented several models ranging from ARIMA/SARIMA to LSTM, optimizing the parameters and evaluating model accuracy in an agile manner

The model was then tested in the real-world and feedback was conducted through interviews with stakeholders.

Forecast of the Lebanese Lira for October 2020

## What's next?

- Implementing a simple UI
- Improving the ML model to include more parameters:
    - Consumer Price Index
    - Market sentiment by analyzing news headline sentiment -NLP
- Developing a web-scraping tool to automate the collection of black market rates
